        <p>
            I'm a current MAT student at North Carolina State University.
            I'm pursuing my degree in math education and plan to teach at the high school level after I graduate in
            December
            of this year.

            A few of my favorite Edtech Resources:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/">GeoGebra</a></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I enjoy using GeoGebra for geometric investigations.
                        It makes creating geometric constructions easy and manipulatable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <strong><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET Simulations</a></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        PhET Simulations has several free, online simulations that students can manipulate and conduct
                        investigations with.
                        It has both math and science simulations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <li>
                        Wolfram Alpha is a free online resource that can both be used as a reference and as an online
                        calculator.

                    <li>
                        Desmos is an online graphing calculator that also allows teachers to create interactive lessons
                        and assignments for students.
